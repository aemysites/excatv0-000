## Chef's Note

There is no singular star ingredient in this smoothie, each one contributes not only amazing flavor but also boasts an impressive nutrient profile. The smoothie is naturally sweetened, thanks to the apples which also add fiber and antioxidants. The soy milk and the peanuts are good sources of protein, with the peanuts providing many additional vitamins and minerals.
