## Ingredients

- 2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 12 ounces chicken andouille sausage
- 4 cups white onion, peeled, cut into chunks
- 2 cups carrots, cut into chunks
- 2 cups celery stalk, cut into chunks
- 3 garlic cloves
- 2 cups Poblano pepper, cut into chunks
- 4 fresh thyme leaves
- 2 Tablespoons chili powder
- 6 roma tomatoes, cut into chunks
- 8 cups vegetable stock
- 62 ounces black beans, cooked, drained, rinsed
- 2 teaspoons sea salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Heat a medium stock pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add olive oil and heat. Add chicken sausage, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, chiles, thyme and chili powder. Saute for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent. Add the stock, tomatoes and black beans and stir to incorporate.

2. Simmer over medium-low heat for 1 1/2 hours.

3. Place the immersion blender into the middle of the stockpot. Submerge the blender below the surface of the liquid, but above the bottom of the pot.

4. Start the blender on its lowest speed, and increase as desired. Move the immersion blender around, including up and down, to blend the ingredients for approximately 2 minutes or until desired consistency is achieved.

5. Serve immediately, or cool in an ice bath and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
