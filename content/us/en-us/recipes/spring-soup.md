## Ingredients

- 1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 2 (200 g) leeks, trimmed, cleaned, sliced into 1/2 in. pieces
- 2 small garlic cloves, peeled, crushed
- 4 (45 g) green onions, separated, whites sliced into 1/2 in. pieces
- 1 medium (225 g) russet potatoes, peeled, sliced into 1/2 in. pieces
- 6 fresh mint leaves
- 1 1/2 cups (50 g) watercress
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon salt, optional
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, sweat down the leek whites, garlic, and green onions whites in olive oil. Add a pinch of salt and cook until softened and just starting to brown.

2. Add sliced potato to the pan and top with enough water to cover the vegetables (approx 2 cups/ 500 ml). Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

3. Carefully transfer the pan contents to the Vitamix container. Add the green onion greens and remaining ingredients. Run the Dips & Spreads Program or start the blender on its lowest speed, then quickly increase to its highest speed. Blend for 60 seconds, using the tamper to push ingredients toward the blades.

4. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Serve immediately, or if serving chilled, cool down rapidly to preserve the lovely bright green color.
