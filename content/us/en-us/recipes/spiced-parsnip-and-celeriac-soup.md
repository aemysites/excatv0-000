## Chef's Note

Use minimal rosemary as it becomes potent when blended. While you can blend this soup without initial simmering, simmering helps reduce astringent flavors from the root vegetables and creates a more mellow, well-rounded taste.

Celery root and celeriac are interchangeable names for the same vegetable - a knobby root with a mild celery flavor that becomes sweet and creamy when cooked.
