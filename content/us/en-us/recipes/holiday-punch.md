## Chef's Note

Mocktails are a great way to enjoy social occasions with a health-conscious twist. Have all ingredients for this punch pre-chilled so you can serve immediately! Alternatively, make ahead of time and chill until ready to serve. Garnish with fresh orange slices, pomegranate arils, and/or toasted cinnamon sticks.

For boozy punch: add 4 ounces of spiced rum or orange liquor (or both) & replace the ginger kombucha with a sparkling wine of your choice.
