## Ingredients

- 2 medium (300 g) tomatoes, halved
- 5 (25 g) garlic cloves, peeled
- ¼ cup (8 g) packed fresh parsley leaves
- 1 medium (180 g) yellow onion, peeled, halved
- 1 Tablespoon (15 ml) vegetable oil, optional
- ½ Tablespoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup Peanut Butter
- 2 ½ cups (600 ml) vegetable broth, plus more as needed
- 1 small (150 g) russet potato, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 small (150 g) sweet potato, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 medium (150 g) carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 (15 g) scotch bonnet pepper [or habanero], optional
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, optional

## Directions

1. Place tomatoes, garlic, parsley, and half the onion into the Vitamix container in the order listed and secure the lid.

2. Start the blender on its lowest speed, then quickly increase to Variable 7. Blend for 10–20 seconds, using the tamper to push ingredients toward the blades. Sauce should be uniform, but not smooth.

3. Roughly chop the other half of the onion. Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add oil (if using). Sauté the chopped onion for 2–3 minutes, until tender. Pour the blended ingredients into the pan. Add paprika and black pepper. Sauté for about 8 minutes, until starting to thicken, stirring frequently to prevent burning.

4. Add 1/2 cup fresh peanut butter, vegetable broth, potato, sweet potato, carrots, whole chile pepper (if using) and salt (if using). Stir to combine and continue cooking over medium heat until vegetables are cooked through, 10–15 minutes more. Remove the whole chile pepper, if used. If stew is too thin, simmer for a few more minutes to thicken it. If too thick, add a bit of vegetable broth or water to thin it out. Serve over fresh steamed rice or couscous and garnish with ground peanuts and parsley.

## Chef's Note

Maafe is often made with beef or chicken. To adjust this recipe, boil 1–2 pounds of meat until tender and reserve the water as broth for the stew. You can then brown the meat in a large saucepan and set aside to add back into the stew at the very end.

This plant-based version of Maafe, a traditional West African peanut stew, is both comforting and nutrient-dense. Made with tomatoes, sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, carrots, and scotch bonnet pepper, it delivers a rich mix of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Sweet potatoes and carrots are excellent sources of beta-carotene (vitamin A), which supports vision and immune health, while white potatoes provide potassium and vitamin B6 for energy metabolism. Tomatoes add vitamin C and lycopene, a powerful antioxidant.

The base of the stew features peanut butter, which adds a creamy texture along with plant protein, healthy fats, and important nutrients like magnesium and vitamin E. This combination makes vegetarian Maafe a satisfying, balanced dish that supports heart health and sustained energy.

Spice levels will vary based on the optional usage of chile peppers; while scotch bonnets are traditional, any chile will do. To add more heat, blend the whole pepper in with the tomatoes, garlic, parsley, and onion.
