# Asparagus and Cashew Cream Soup

Keep soups simple, flavorful and creamy by blending cashews instead of dairy, and keeping some ingredients raw to cut back on prep time.

## Chef's Note

We love simply using raw asparagus in this soup and letting the Vitamix do the work for you, but you can use steamed or roasted asparagus, both fresh or leftover, to make a delicious hot soup in minutes.
