## Chef's Note

Strain through a nut milk bag or strainer. Filtering the juice will remove the fiber, try drinking this juice as a smoothie when you are in a hurry. Ginger adds great flavor but adding to much can over power, start with a small amount and add more to the blend after you have tried it.
