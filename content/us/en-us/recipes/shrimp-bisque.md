## Ingredients

- ¼ cup vegan margarine
- 1 pound shrimp, shelled (shells reserved)
- 1 onion, peeled and chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 1 fennel bulb, chopped
- 2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, optional

## Directions

1. Heat stock pot over medium heat, melt margarine, and par cook shrimp for 2-3 minutes. Reserve 12 shrimp for garnish and set aside.

2. Add shrimp shells, onion, garlic, celery, and fennel to the pot. Cook until vegetables are browned, about 5-7 minutes.

3. Add flour and tomato paste, stirring to coat vegetables. Deglaze the pot with white wine.

4. Add kosher salt (if using), cayenne pepper (if using), bay leaf, and vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes.

## Chef's Note

A traditional bisque uses crustacean broth made from shells to create its signature rich flavor. The Vitamix allows you to pulverize the shells completely, extracting maximum flavor and creating a luxuriously smooth texture.

This recipe can be made gluten-free by substituting rice flour for all-purpose flour. The bisque is also naturally lighter than traditional cream-based versions while maintaining its rich, indulgent taste.
