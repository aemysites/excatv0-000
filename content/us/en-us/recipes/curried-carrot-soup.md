## Chef's Note

Using raw ingredients in a soup is a simple way to use the power of your Vitamix. Sautéing the onions and carrots beforehand will enrich the flavor and remove some of the potency of stronger ingredients like onions. To thin out thick soups, just add more liquid to the blend. To thicken soups, add more hearty ingredients and continue to blend.
