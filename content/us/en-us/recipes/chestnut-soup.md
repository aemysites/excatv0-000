- 1 Tablespoon (30 ml) olive oil
- ½ small (55 g) onion, chopped
- ½ (50 g) celery stalk, chopped
- ½ medium (50 g) carrot, chopped
- 1 garlic clove
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, optional
- 3 cups (720 ml) vegetable broth
- 1 small dried bay leaf
- 7 ½ ounces (215 g) roasted chestnuts

## Directions

1. Heat a large saucepan over medium heat add the olive oil. Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and salt. Cook until soft, about 8 minutes.

2. Add broth, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 5 minutes.

3. Add chestnuts and simmer until chestnuts and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Remove bay leaf.

4. Place soup into the Vitamix container and secure the lid. Start the blender on its lowest speed, then quickly increase to its highest speed. Blend for 45 seconds, using the tamper to push ingredients toward the blades.

5. Return soup to saucepan, add milk and sherry, and reheat gently. Season with additional salt if desired.

## Chef's Note

Chestnuts are one of the lesser used tree nuts, but still just as nutrient dense that are rich in nutrients linked to many health benefits. They are packed with fiber, minerals, and vitamins, especially vitamin C!
