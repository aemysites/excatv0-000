## Chef's Note

Traditional Tonkotsu broth is carefully boiled for 8 to 24 or even 48 hours to extract maximum flavor from the pork bones and create that signature cloudy, creamy appearance. Here, the pressure cooker extracts flavor and the immersion blender emulsifies, resulting in the same end product in less than half the time.
