## Ingredients

- 1 cup white rice, long grain
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 Tablespoons fresh ginger root, minced
- 4 Chinese sausage, diced
- 12 cups chicken stock
- 1 Tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 Tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 Tablespoon fresh mint leaves
- 1 thai red chilies, thinly sliced
- 1 Tablespoon green onion, thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Add long grain rice to the Vitamix container and secure the lid. Start the blender on its lowest speed, then quickly increase to its highest speed. Blend for 25-30 seconds, using the tamper to push ingredients toward the blades or until rice looks broken (not finely ground).

2. In a large, wide pot, over medium heat, add the sesame oil and the broken rice. Stir gently, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the rice is evenly toasted. Add the ginger and diced sausage and saute for an additional 2 to 3 minutes to release their flavors. Next, add the chicken stock, bring to a simmer, and lower the heat to medium low. Cover the pot, and allow the rice mixture to cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes. The rice will be slightly overcooked, and the broth will thicken from the starch in the rice.

3. Once the congee is cooked, top with the remaining ingredients per one-cup serving.
