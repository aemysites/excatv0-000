## Chef's Note

Garnish with sour cream and diced apples. Soup may vary in color depending on the types of apples and cheese that you use. Potato should be baked, while the veggies are raw. By cooking all ingredients beforehand, you will get a sweeter soup. Season to taste at the end with more spices, herbs, and cheese to suit your taste preference.
